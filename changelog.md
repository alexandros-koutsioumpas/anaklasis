- Introduction of additional _Python_ reflectivity calculation engine (accelarated with _Numba_), so that now a FORTRAN compiler is not necessary for installation of the package (although recommended). 
- small update of the package documentation
- Addition of ORSO validation tests in the test script.

## Version 1.5.2 (August 2021)

- change of resolution convolution limits
- update of the test script

## Version 1.5.1 (August 2021)

- enforcement of correct branch cut for complex sqrt calculations
- correction of a numerical roundoff error related bug
- update of the test script
- slightly faster reflectivity calculation engine

## Version 1.5 (August 2021)

- correction of a bug in the resolution convolution
- update of the test script


## Version 1.4.6 (June 2021)

- inclusion of script templates for common data-refinement workflows
- added example (ORSO data)
- multiprocessing changes
- Calculation tests performed and passed for this release!

## Version 1.4.5 (June 2021)

- minor code changes
- minor multiprocessing changes
- Calculation tests performed and passed for this release! 

## Version 1.4 (June 2021)

- Sld and solvent profiles now calculated with Fortran extension (faster)
- Major speed improovements for Hessian Matrix estimation
- Calculation tests performed and passed for this release! 

## Version 1.3 (June 2021)

- changes in project structure and new type of return structures (multi-key dictionary)
- update of example scripts incorporating project changes
- backward compatibility of written scriprs guarantied from this version onward
- test script for core calculations introduced. All future releases will be tested against calculations generated by version 1.3
